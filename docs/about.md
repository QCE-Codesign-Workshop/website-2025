## Abstract

There are many proposed hardware implementations for quantum computing. Each is marked by technical challenges and physical limitations. In order to optimize hardware performance, it is critical to consider both the abstract device model and its particular architecture, noise, and error characteristics. This workshop specifically focuses on the design of device-aware quantum software, and the benefits of specialization. It is divided into three focus areas across different layers of the quantum computing stack: control and calibration, noisy classical simulation, and device-aware error correction.

-  Quantum control can be used to synthesize unique hardware primitives and mitigate device-specific errors, but efficient calibration using feedback is critical for success. This focus area emphasizes device-aware machine learning strategies for quantum control and calibration.
- Classical simulation of quantum devices is necessary for studying control, circuit validation, and architecture design. Whether simulating state vectors or logical circuits, this focus area discusses important advances in scalable, noise-aware versions of classical simulators.
- Error rates of quantum hardware currently operate at a juncture where low-distance error correction is implementable. Pushing the frontier requires consideration of all device irregularities in the design of quantum error correcting codes and decoders. In this focus area, device-aware error correcting codes and decoders are discussed. 

In each focus area, four invited speakers will give research talks, then join together for a panel. By concentrating on the way developers of device-aware quantum software work together with hardware experts, this workshop provides opportunities for co-design and cross-layer optimization that can push forward the capabilities of todayâ€™s quantum hardware.
